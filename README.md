# Fox-Knight Quest

3D platformer on Unity.
This is the story of a fox knight who strangely appears on a heavenly platform and tries to leave it, collecting coins and killing monsters.

### Features:
* Each level contains a certain amount of coins that you need to collect in order to open the portal to the next level;
* Platforms moving in different directions create additional difficulties for the passage of the game;
* Anemies trying to kill when you try to pass by;
* The rotation of the character is carried out by rotating the camera, which can be challenging in the first steps of the game.

#### * The major amount of used assets in this project I took from official Unity Asset Store. Others took from other sites and drawn by myself.
